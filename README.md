# HACKERS turn-based text game
# [Full write-up is on my website!](https://iamericmin.github.io/hackersgame.html)

Project status: Finished. Feel free to use or modify my code!

## What is it?
This is a turn-based text game I made for my AP Computer Science Principles mid-term project at high school. It is written purely in Python 3.7.

## GAMEPLAY
It's just like Pokemon. Each side takes a turn. There are three attack moves and two status moves for each side. The three attack moves are like rock-paper-scissors. One move is effective against one and weak against the other. The damage inflicted is decided on which move the player and the computer chose. Status moves inflict a lingering effect on the opponent that lasts for five turns. They can reduce the opponent's accuracy by half or gradually take away small amounts of health. Status moves can change the playing field if used strategically. The computer decides its moves randomly.

## DEPENDENCIES
The only dependency is to have pythondialog installed for Python 3.7. I think. You see, it doesn't work on my computer and I know for sure that my machine has both Pythondialog and Python 3.7. So I think it's something wrong with my $PATH and not the actual game code. I might be wrong tho
