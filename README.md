# HACKERS turn-based text game
# [Full write-up is on my website!](https://iamericmin.github.io/hackersgame.html)

Project status: Finished. Feel free to use or modify my code!

## What is it?
It is the 80's. The synth is wavy. Michael Jackson is still black. Thankfully, things are not like how Orwell anticipated. Life is actually pretty good.

But you have no time to lose. SKYNET, a rouge AI, is going to kill your mother. Fortunately, you are an expert hacker and is determined to save your mom from certain death. You need to hack into SKYNET's mainframe and disable their algorithms. You slip on your NES Powerglove. The fate of this world rests on your Commodore 64.

This is a game I made for my AP Computer Science Principles class in my junior year of high school. It's completely written in Python3 and while the game has some minor bugs, it is fully playable.

## GAMEPLAY
It's just like Pokemon. Each side takes a turn. There are three attack moves and two status moves for each side. The three attack moves are like rock-paper-scissors. One move is effective against one and weak against the other. The damage inflicted is decided on which move the player and the computer chose. Status moves inflict a lingering effect on the opponent that lasts for five turns. They can reduce the opponent's accuracy by half or gradually take away small amounts of health. Status moves can change the playing field if used strategically. The computer decides its moves randomly.

## DEPENDENCIES
The only dependency is to have pythondialog installed for Python 3.7. I think. You see, it doesn't work on my computer and I know for sure that my machine has both Pythondialog and Python 3.7. So I think it's something wrong with my $PATH and not the actual game code. I might be wrong tho

# HAVE FUN!
